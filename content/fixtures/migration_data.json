            "practice_text": "The firm of Karpeles & Associates practices in three primary areas.  Over the years, the majority of the firm's business has come from construction and real estate law, where we represent material suppliers, general contractors, and contractors in all phases of construction law and litigation, with an emphasis upon debt recovery through mechanic's liens and other remedies.  This foundation of practice has allowed the attorneys of the firm to expand into other areas of litigation and transactional practice, as well.  A large portion of our practice can be characterized as business litigation, in which we represent businesses, large and small, from corporations to sole proprietorships, in their various legal needs, including breach of contract actions, creditor's rights, and collections.  \r\n\r\nLastly, in recent years, the firm has developed a growing practice in bankruptcy, on behalf of both creditors and debtors.  This practice takes the form of Chapter 7, 13, and 11 bankruptcy representation for debtors, adversary actions brought by creditors, and the defense of preference payment and similar suits brought by bankruptcy trustees against creditors of the bankruptcy estate.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on our practice areas, please see the following links:\r\n    "
